# MVC_TechBlog
AS A developer who writes about tech
I WANT a CMS-style blog site
SO THAT I can publish articles, blog posts, and my thoughts and opinions
## Description

As a developer it is nice to look at forums for tech items - this helps to keep me up to date on what is going on in the tech world.  This app is the front end and backend for a tech blog where you can login and add/ delete comments about different technologies.

This challenge was definitely a challenge.  Bringing all the pieces together was very difficult.  I learned that I do not like handlebars, the overall concept makes sense but actually using it was not going in my favor.

I wrote a lot of code and as able to get my login to work and other routes but the front end just never came together.

## Installation

If you pull up the application you can simply run an npm i to install the packages - you can then use 'npm run start' to kick off the server.  Once there you can take the url and use it in insomnia to test the routes.

The other option is to connect to the heroku live app here and dive in:  https://vast-wildwood-33005.herokuapp.com/

## Usage

Once you go to the heroku live app as mentioned above or below you should be able to log in and begin writing comments.
